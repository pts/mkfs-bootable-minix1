; mbr_bootlace.nasm: Minix 1.5 bootlace boot code that can be put to a HDD MBR
; MBR-specific code and size optimizations by pts@fazekas.hu at Fri Oct 24 19:14:53 CEST 2025
;
; Compile for /shoelace with: nasm-0.98.39 -O0 -w+orphan-labels -f bin -o mbr_bootlace.bin mbr_bootlace.nasm
; Compile for /minix    with: nasm-0.98.39 -O0 -w+orphan-labels -f bin -DMINIX -o mbr_bootminix.bin mbr_bootlace.nasm
;
; Based on the following Minix 1.5 source files:
;
; * /usr/oz/shoelace/bootlace.x (1990-04-24)
; * /usr/oz/shoelace/shoeasm.x (1990-04-24)
; * /usr/oz/shoelace/shoebfs.c (1990-04-24)
; * /usr/oz/shoelace/shoeboot.c (1990-04-24)
;
; This boot code can boot Minix 1.5 (both 8086 and i386) from a HDD which
; doesn't have partitions, but the minix1 filesystem is created to span over
; the entire HDD (i.e. /dev/hd0).
;
; Here is how you should prepare such a bootable filesystem image for
; mbr_minix.bin:
;
; 1. Create the Minix filesystem.
; 2. Copy your minix kernel image file (typically larger than 128 KiB) as
;    /minix, to the root directory of the fileystem.
; 3. Unmount the filesystem.
; 4. Copy the binary version of this code (mbr_bootminix.bin) to the first two
;    sectors of the HDD. On a Linux host, if the Minix filesystem image
;    filename is *hd.img*, you can do this by running `dd if=mbr_bootlace.bin
;    of=hd.img count=2 conv=notrunc`.
; 5. There is not need to create a partition table. *mbr_bootminix.bin*
;    already has one. The Minix root partition will be /dev/hd4 (or dev/hd4,
;    /if booting from the 2nd HDD). (It also works as /dev/hd0.)
;    There is no need to configure this, it will be autodetected on boot.
;
; Here is how you should prepare such a bootable filesystem image for
; mbe_bootlace.bin:
;
; 1. Create the Minix filesystem.
; 2. Copy the file named shoelace of the ShoeLace bootloader to the root
;    directory of the fileystem.
; 3. If you have a Minix kernel image, then extract the 4 component files
;    kernel, mm, fs, and init using
;    [split_minix_kernel.pl](https://github.com/pts/mkfs-bootable-minix1/blob/master/split_minix_kernel.pl).
; 4. Create the directory /etc/system on the filesystem, and copy the kernel
;    component files kernel, mm, fs, and init there.
; 5. Create a the file /etc/config on the filesystem with the following
;    contents:
;    ```
;    kernel /etc/system/kernel
;    mm /etc/system/mm
;    fs /etc/system/fs
;    init /etc/system/init
;    ```
; 6. Unmount the filesystem.
; 7. Copy the binary version of this code (mbr_bootlace.bin) to the first two
;    sectors of the HDD. On a Linux host, if the Minix filesystem image
;    filename is *hd.img*, you can do this by running `dd if=mbr_bootlace.bin
;    of=hd.img count=2 conv=notrunc`.
; 8. There is not need to create a partition table. *mbr_bootlace.bin*
;    already has one. The Minix root partition will be /dev/hd4. There is no
;    need to configure this, it will be autodetected on boot.

; NAME
;      BootLace - bootstrap the ShoeLace
;
; DESCRIPTION
;      /etc/bootlace contains the code that will be written into
;      the boot block of a Minix file system to make it bootable.
;      Some of the information in the file is incomplete and must
;      be patched by LaceUp in order to make a volume bootable.
;
;      BootLace is not directly executable from Minix.
;
; OPERATION
;      BootLace contains two pieces of code. The first piece is
;      that contained within the boot sector. This contains suffi-
;      cient code to retrieve the rest of the code in the boot
;      block and to set up enough of the environment to run the
;      basic file system scanner.
;
;      The main task undertaken by BootLace is to locate the file
;      /shoelace on the boot volume and to read it into memory.
;
;      BootLace is loaded at address 0x7c00 by the BIOS bootstrap
;      loader.  BootLace will load ShoeLace at address 0x10000 in
;      order to avoid problems caused by 64kb dma wraparound.  Once
;      ShoeLace is loaded, BootLace relinquishes control by making
;      a far call to address 0x10000.  ShoeLace is able to locate
;      the start of the boot block image examining the return
;      address that is pushed onto the stack. Two data objects can
;      be obtained from BootLace corpse:
;
;           1  the disk code needed to access the boot volume via
;              the BIOS
;
;           2  the boot parameter block.
;
;      BootLace also points the floppy parameter table vector to an
;      internal version of the table if the boot device is a floppy
;      disk. It is important that this vector be changed if other
;      code is subsequently loaded on the BootLace corpse.

; high memory and a suitable stack set up.
;
; Edit History:

;               out dynamic floppy sizing. Convert to .s format.
; 22-Apr-1989   Remove intersegment read capability
; 20-Apr-1989   Added hclicksize
; 17-Apr-1989   Moved movsw back in, take out loadseg
; 16-Apr-1989   Moved shoelace code movsw out of boot block
; 15-Apr-1989   Squeeze code
; 14-Apr-1989   Add loadseg to indicate top of shoelace
; 30-Mar-1989   Some cosmetic surgery to include VECTORSEG
; 29-Oct-1988   Moved shoelace higher to 256kb boundary
; 29-Sep-1988   Added cret and csv for portability
; 18-Sep-1988   Added jump to start
; 16-Apr-1988   Modelled on minix boot code
